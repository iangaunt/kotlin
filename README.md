# kotlin: (mid) java
Throughout my years as a programmer, and throughout my one year of Java development, I've thought "... This is garbage". Well, now that I've found Kotlin, I can finally see that it is what I have been missing. It is the light at the end of the tunnel. It is a hug from a family member, the first gift you open on Christmas. It is everything I have ever wanted and more. 

Kotlin > Java.

This is a horrible post. Why did I think this. 
Anyways, I like Java. It is cool, and Kotlin doesn't have enough support for me to GAF.
Thanks, anyway.
